This project was carried out using FiveTran to ingest data into Snowflake environment.
Using AWS S3 bucket storage facility,  I connected fivetran to Aws to extract the raw files
Then integrated fivetran to slowflake environment, where the files were cleaned, transformed and enhanced for dashboarding purposes,
by creating optimized SQL queries and objects.
